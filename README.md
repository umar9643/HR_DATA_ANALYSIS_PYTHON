üîë Key Insights
1. Employee Status & Workforce Composition

Most employees are active, but a significant number have resigned or been terminated, pointing to areas where retention strategies need strengthening.

2. Departmental Distribution

Some departments are overstaffed, while others are relatively small, suggesting that workload and hiring strategies are uneven across the organization.

3. Salary Trends Across Departments & Roles

Technical and managerial roles receive higher salaries than administrative or support functions.

Within the same department, job titles show large salary variations, reflecting differences in skill demand and responsibility levels.

4. Work Mode Preferences

The majority of employees are on-site, though a growing number work remotely. Remote employees earn salaries similar to on-site staff, suggesting the organization values skillset over work location.

5. Attrition & Resignations

Certain departments have high resignation and termination rates, making them hotspots for attrition. These departments may suffer from dissatisfaction, workload stress, or lack of career growth.

6. Salary vs Experience

Salary generally increases with years of experience, but the rate is inconsistent. Some employees with similar experience earn very different salaries, highlighting gaps in pay standardization.

7. Performance Ratings

Departments differ in average performance ratings, suggesting variation in leadership quality, training programs, and work culture across teams.

8. Country-Wise Concentration

A few countries host the largest employee bases, making them organizational hubs. Heavy reliance on certain regions could pose risks if local business conditions change.

9. Salary vs Performance Correlation

There is a positive but moderate correlation between salary and performance rating. High performers generally earn more, but performance-based rewards may not be fully optimized.

10. Hiring Trends Over Time

The number of hires fluctuates yearly, reflecting periods of aggressive recruitment followed by slowdowns. This inconsistency may affect workforce stability.

11. Top Earners

Top earners in each department have salaries far above the department average, creating a visible salary gap between high performers and the rest of the workforce.

12. Departments with High Attrition

A few departments stand out with the highest resignation percentages, requiring urgent HR attention to prevent productivity and morale losses.

‚úÖ Conclusion

This HR analysis highlights both strengths and challenges in the workforce. The company has a strong base of active employees and competitive pay for top roles, but also faces attrition challenges, salary imbalances, and uneven departmental distribution.

The results show that while employees are generally well-compensated, inconsistencies in pay, performance management, and workforce planning could impact employee satisfaction and long-term stability.
